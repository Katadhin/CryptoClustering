# CryptoClustering

## Project Overview
The CryptoClustering project aims to classify cryptocurrencies based on their price fluctuations across various timeframes using the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA). By analyzing price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year, the project seeks to identify clusters of cryptocurrencies exhibiting similar price behaviors.
